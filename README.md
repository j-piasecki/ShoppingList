# ShoppingList
Shopping list app with real-time lists synchronization.

You can check it out [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.jpiasecki.shoppinglist).

The main goal of this app was to learn as much as possible. It is my first project in kotlin, first time using a dependency injection library, first time using MVVM pattern, and first time using Firestore.
